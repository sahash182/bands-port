BaNd-PoRts:
This is a really cool application which will allow users to either promote your music (bands) OR 
find local music in the area, also it will allows users to find cool bands near your area from the zip code.
  In this app as the name alsd says it it's a place where bands live(information about bands shows, pictures genre etc), and user can also access 
  all the bands information too.
  On creating this app, i have used my fullstack javascript technological skills that i have learned from General Assembly
  , and some of these technologies can also be found on the node modules folder.
